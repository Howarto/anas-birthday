# Ana's birthday

Hi!,

This project is created due to two things: **I want to make a surprise for my gf with a simple story and practice more ReactJS with Redux!**

I am full of work these weeks due to I am packaging many things in my house to leave Barcelona at the end of this month. However, I will achieve to make this simple project! ðŸ’ª

I have only 7 day. Sooooo, turn on the f** coffee machine babeeeeee! ðŸ˜Ž

## How to run it

As always in create-react-app projects:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
